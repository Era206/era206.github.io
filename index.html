               <p>
                Hello, I'm <b>Sanjida Islam Era</b>.
                I am currently working as a <b>Software Engineer</b> at <b>Therap (BD) Ltd.</b>, where I design and develop production-level software systems with a strong emphasis on reliability, usability, and real-world impact. I joined Therap in <b>July 2024</b> as an <b>Associate Software Engineer</b> and was promoted to <b>Software Engineer</b> in <b>July 2025</b>. Alongside my industry role, I actively pursue research at the intersection of <b>Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)</b>, <b>Natural Language Processing</b>, and <b>Cybersecurity</b>.
                
                <br/><br/>
                
                I completed my undergraduate B.Sc. degree in <b>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</b> at the <b>Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)</b>, where I developed a strong foundation in computing, system design, and research-oriented problem solving. My academic training, combined with hands-on industry experience, has shaped my approach to building systems that are not only technically sound but also human-centered and accessible.
                
                <br/><br/>
                
                My research work focuses on <b>usability and accessibility evaluation</b>, <b>security-aware NLP systems</b>, and <b>Bangla language technologies</b>. I have worked on projects analyzing the accessibility and usability of government and non-government websites, as well as developing NLP-based approaches for cybersecurity-related text analysis. These projects reflect my broader interest in understanding how users interact with complex systems and how thoughtful design can improve both accessibility and trust in technology.
                
                <br/><br/>
                
                Beyond work and research, I enjoy painting, dancing, travelling, trying new food, and expressing creativity through art and design. I believe that meaningful innovation emerges from a balance of technical rigor, empathy, and curiosity, and I strive to carry these values into both my professional and academic pursuits.

          <h4><a href="blank">Therap BD at BUET</a></h4>
          <p>
            This was a meaningful and memorable experience, as I had the opportunity to represent <b>Therap (BD) Ltd.</b> at my academic institution, <b>BUET</b>. I delivered a presentation on Therap’s work culture, career pathways, and long-term vision, engaging directly with students and faculty members of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
            <br/><br/>
            During the session, I closely coordinated with Therap’s leadership, including its CEO, <b>Richard Robbins</b>, to present insights into how <b>artificial intelligence</b> is shaping the future of software systems and how Therap is progressively integrating AI-driven solutions into its products and services. The event also served as a platform to strengthen cooperative engagement between <b>Therap</b> and <b>CSE, BUET</b>, fostering dialogue around industry–academia collaboration.
            <br/><br/>
            The session concluded with an interactive Q&A segment, where we addressed a wide range of questions from students regarding Therap’s engineering culture, recruitment process, real-world problem solving, and the role of AI in building scalable, impactful healthcare software. Overall, the experience was both professionally enriching and personally rewarding, allowing me to contribute to knowledge exchange between industry and academia.

              Therap Interview Experience (Associate Software Engineer) ’24
            </a>
          </h4>
          <p>
            My interview process at <b>Therap (BD) Ltd.</b> was both rigorous and rewarding, marking an important milestone at the beginning of my professional career. Prior to the interviews, I prepared extensively by practicing algorithmic problem-solving using platforms such as <b>LeetCode</b> and <b>Codeforces</b>, with particular focus on dynamic programming, data structures, and core problem-solving techniques.
            <br/><br/>
            The process began with a written assessment, where the majority of the questions were centered around <b>coding challenges and database-related problem solving</b>. I was able to answer <b>9 out of 10 questions correctly</b>, which reflected my preparation and understanding of fundamental software engineering concepts.
            <br/><br/>
            This was followed by an in-depth technical interview conducted by <b>Md. Nazrul Islam</b>, Director of Software Operations at Therap, who leads the organization’s software development efforts. During this round, I actively engaged in technical discussions, solved coding problems collaboratively, and demonstrated my reasoning and approach to real-world engineering challenges.
            <br/><br/>
            Overall, the interview experience was intellectually stimulating and professionally enriching, and it culminated in an offer for the role of <b>Associate Software Engineer</b> at Therap (BD) Ltd.

          <h4><a href="_blank">Chaldal Interview Experience (L1 Software Engineer) ’24</a></h4>
          <p>
            I went through a multi-stage, fully technical interview process at <b>Chaldal</b>, consisting of three in-depth coding interviews conducted by senior engineering leadership. Each round focused on problem-solving, data structures, and real-world engineering reasoning, and involved different technical decision-makers, including senior engineers and the Chief Software Engineer.
            <br/><br/>
            Following the initial technical rounds and a discussion with the CTO, I was invited to an additional interview with the Product Head, where the conversation centered on product thinking, engineering–product collaboration, and decision-making in large-scale systems.
            <br/><br/>
            The interview process concluded with a final technical and strategic discussion with <b>Waseem Alim</b>, the CEO of Chaldal. Based on my overall performance across these interviews, Chaldal introduced a newly tailored role for me—<b>L1 Software Engineer (Product)</b>—reflecting a hybrid focus on both engineering and product responsibilities.
            <br/><br/>
            This interview journey was particularly engaging and formative at an early stage of my career. Although I ultimately chose to decline the offer, the experience provided valuable insight into high-bar technical interviews and product-driven engineering culture.

  <h4>K-BERT-En: Integrating Knowledge Graphs for Improved English Language Representation</h4>
  <p>
    <em>Undergraduate Thesis Work</em><br/>
    This thesis explored enhancing English language representations by integrating structured knowledge graphs into transformer-based language models. We adapted and evaluated a knowledge-enhanced BERT framework (K-BERT-En) to improve performance on both open-domain and domain-specific NLP tasks while mitigating knowledge noise.<br/>
    <b>Supervisor:</b> Dr. Muhammad Masroor Ali <br/>
    <b>Research topics:</b> Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Graphs, Transformer Models <br/>
    <b>Method:</b> Knowledge-enhanced BERT (K-BERT), soft-position embeddings, visible matrix–based masked self-attention; 
    <b>Datasets:</b> Goodreads Reviews, WNUT 2017 NER, Hate-Speech Corpus; 
    <b>Knowledge Graphs:</b> FB15K-237 and a custom hate-speech KG <br/>
    <b>My contribution:</b> Co-designed the study, implemented and adapted the K-BERT-En pipeline for English, conducted experiments and result analysis, and contributed substantially to the thesis writing.

    <h4>Exploring Few-Shot Learning for Named Entity Recognition in Cyber Threat Intelligence</h4>
    <p>
      <em>Research Paper</em><br/>
      This work investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning approaches for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) domain. We conducted a comprehensive comparison between few-shot large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, and Gemini) and fine-tuned transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) using benchmark CTI datasets, highlighting the limitations of few-shot learning in domain-specific, complex NLP tasks.<br/>
      <b>Research topics:</b> Natural Language Processing, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Few-Shot Learning, Named Entity Recognition <br/>
      <b>Method:</b> Few-shot prompting with GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, and Gemini (1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-shot settings); comparative evaluation against fine-tuned transformer models <br/>
      <b>Datasets:</b> DNRTI and APTNER cybersecurity NER benchmarks <br/>
      <b>My contribution:</b> Led the design and execution of the few-shot learning experiments, including prompt formulation, shot selection strategies, experimental evaluation, and comparative analysis of few-shot model performance.
